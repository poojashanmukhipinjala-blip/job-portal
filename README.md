# Job Market Data Analysis & Visualization (Tableau)

This repository contains the complete work carried out during my **Data Analytics Internship at NullClass**, focusing on analyzing real-world job market data using **Tableau**. The project demonstrates the application of business rules, data filtering logic, calculated fields, and professional data visualizations to extract meaningful insights from structured datasets.

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze job posting data and present insights through various Tableau visualizations. The dataset includes attributes such as job titles, roles, experience, salary range, qualifications, company size, geographic location, job portal, and recruiter details.

Multiple analytical tasks were completed as part of the internship, each designed to simulate real-world business intelligence scenarios.

## 📊 Tasks Implemented

### 🔹 Task 1 – Preference vs Work Type (Bar Chart)
- Analyzed internship preferences using conditional filters.
- Applied geographic, experience, salary, and company size constraints.

### 🔹 Task 2 – Company Size vs Company Name (Scatter Plot)
- Studied company size distribution for selected job roles.
- Implemented string-based and numeric filtering logic.

### 🔹 Task 3 – Top 10 Companies (Tree Map)
- Identified top hiring companies for specific roles.
- Applied ranking, geographic exclusion, and date-based filters.

### 🔹 Task 4 – Qualification Drilldown Map
- Visualized job postings using latitude and longitude.
- Enabled interactive drilldown through map zoom and tooltips.

### 🔹 Task 5 – India vs Germany Comparison (Stacked Bar Chart)
- Compared job postings between two countries.
- Applied qualification, experience, portal, and salary conditions.

### 🔹 Task 6 – Work Type Salary Distribution (Box Plot)
- Analyzed salary distribution for intern roles.
- Used even-experience logic and multiple exclusion rules.

## 🧮 Key Concepts Applied

- Calculated fields for text-to-numeric conversion
- REGEXP-based extraction for experience and salary handling
- Conditional filtering using logical operators
- Geographic visualization using Latitude & Longitude
- Ranking and sorting for top-N analysis
- Interactive tooltips and drilldown behavior

## ⚠️ Handling Blank Visualizations

Some tasks resulted in blank charts due to the application of highly restrictive business rules (e.g., latitude limits, experience parity, and string-based conditions).  
This behavior reflects **correct filter implementation** rather than errors.  
In such cases, the analytical logic was retained while selectively relaxing constraints for visualization and explanation purposes.
